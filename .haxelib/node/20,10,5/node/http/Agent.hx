/**
	An `Agent` is responsible for managing connection persistence
	and reuse for HTTP clients. It maintains a queue of pending requests
	for a given host and port, reusing a single socket connection for each
	until the queue is empty, at which time the socket is either destroyed
	or put into a pool where it is kept to be used again for requests to the
	same host and port. Whether it is destroyed or pooled depends on the`keepAlive` `option`.
	
	Pooled connections have TCP Keep-Alive enabled for them, but servers may
	still close idle connections, in which case they will be removed from the
	pool and a new connection will be made when a new HTTP request is made for
	that host and port. Servers may also refuse to allow multiple requests
	over the same connection, in which case the connection will have to be
	remade for every request and cannot be pooled. The `Agent` will still make
	the requests to that server, but each one will occur over a new connection.
	
	When a connection is closed by the client or the server, it is removed
	from the pool. Any unused sockets in the pool will be unrefed so as not
	to keep the Node.js process running when there are no outstanding requests.
	(see `socket.unref()`).
	
	It is good practice, to `destroy()` an `Agent` instance when it is no
	longer in use, because unused sockets consume OS resources.
	
	Sockets are removed from an agent when the socket emits either
	a `'close'` event or an `'agentRemove'` event. When intending to keep one
	HTTP request open for a long time without keeping it in the agent, something
	like the following may be done:
	
	```js
	http.get(options, (res) => {
	   // Do stuff
	}).on('socket', (socket) => {
	   socket.emit('agentRemove');
	});
	```
	
	An agent may also be used for an individual request. By providing`{agent: false}` as an option to the `http.get()` or `http.request()`functions, a one-time use `Agent` with default options
	will be used
	for the client connection.
	
	`agent:false`:
	
	```js
	http.get({
	   hostname: 'localhost',
	   port: 80,
	   path: '/',
	   agent: false,  // Create a new agent just for this one request
	}, (res) => {
	   // Do stuff with response
	});
	```

		`removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
		listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
		listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be
		called multiple times to remove each instance.
		
		Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the
		time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any`removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls _after_ emitting and _before_ the last listener finishes execution
		will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.
		
		```js
		import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
		class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
		const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
		
		const callbackA = () => {
		   console.log('A');
		   myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
		};
		
		const callbackB = () => {
		   console.log('B');
		};
		
		myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);
		
		myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);
		
		// callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
		// Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		//   B
		
		// callbackB is now removed.
		// Internal listener array [callbackA]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		```
		
		Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will
		change the position indices of any listener registered _after_ the listener
		being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called,
		but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by
		the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.
		
		When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single
		event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most
		recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')`listener is removed:
		
		```js
		import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
		const ee = new EventEmitter();
		
		function pong() {
		   console.log('pong');
		}
		
		ee.on('ping', pong);
		ee.once('ping', pong);
		ee.removeListener('ping', pong);
		
		ee.emit('ping');
		ee.emit('ping');
		```
