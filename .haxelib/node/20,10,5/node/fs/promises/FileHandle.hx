		Unlike the 16 KiB default `highWaterMark` for a `stream.Readable`, the stream
		returned by this method has a default `highWaterMark` of 64 KiB.
		
		`options` can include `start` and `end` values to read a range of bytes from
		the file instead of the entire file. Both `start` and `end` are inclusive and
		start counting at 0, allowed values are in the
		\[0, [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)\] range. If `start` is
		omitted or `undefined`, `filehandle.createReadStream()` reads sequentially from
		the current file position. The `encoding` can be any one of those accepted by `Buffer`.
		
		If the `FileHandle` points to a character device that only supports blocking
		reads (such as keyboard or sound card), read operations do not finish until data
		is available. This can prevent the process from exiting and the stream from
		closing naturally.
		
		By default, the stream will emit a `'close'` event after it has been
		destroyed.  Set the `emitClose` option to `false` to change this behavior.
		
		```js
		import { open } from 'node:fs/promises';
		
		const fd = await open('/dev/input/event0');
		// Create a stream from some character device.
		const stream = fd.createReadStream();
		setTimeout(() => {
		   stream.close(); // This may not close the stream.
		   // Artificially marking end-of-stream, as if the underlying resource had
		   // indicated end-of-file by itself, allows the stream to close.
		   // This does not cancel pending read operations, and if there is such an
		   // operation, the process may still not be able to exit successfully
		   // until it finishes.
		   stream.push(null);
		   stream.read(0);
		}, 100);
		```
		
		If `autoClose` is false, then the file descriptor won't be closed, even if
		there's an error. It is the application's responsibility to close it and make
		sure there's no file descriptor leak. If `autoClose` is set to true (default
		behavior), on `'error'` or `'end'` the file descriptor will be closed
		automatically.
		
		An example to read the last 10 bytes of a file which is 100 bytes long:
		
		```js
		import { open } from 'node:fs/promises';
		
		const fd = await open('sample.txt');
		fd.createReadStream({ start: 90, end: 99 });
